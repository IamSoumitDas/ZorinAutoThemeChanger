# 🌅 Zorin Auto Theme Changer

Automatically switch between light and dark themes in **Zorin OS Core Edition** based on **sunrise** and **sunset** times.

Zorin Core doesn’t currently support theme switching by sunrise/sunset (only by fixed schedule), so this script brings that feature to life — fully automated.

## 💡 Why I Built This

Zorin OS Core doesn’t include an option to automatically change themes based on the time of day — only by a fixed schedule.  
I prefer my system to follow natural light cycles automatically, so I made this script to do exactly that.
