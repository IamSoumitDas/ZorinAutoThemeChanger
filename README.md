# 🌅 Zorin Auto Theme Changer

Automatically switch between light and dark themes in **Zorin OS Core Edition(Gnome)** based on **sunrise** and **sunset** times. Zorin Core doesn’t currently support theme switching by sunrise/sunset (only by fixed schedule), so this script brings that feature to life — fully automated.

## ✨ Features
 
- 📍 **Flexible Location Options:**
  1. **Manual coordinates** for  **✅100% offline** use (recommended)

- ⏱️ **No background activity** - only runs at the scheduled time
- 🕐 **Automatic Theme Switching** – changes your Zorin theme at local **sunrise** and **sunset**.
